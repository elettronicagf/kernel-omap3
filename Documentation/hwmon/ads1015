This device is a 12-bit A-D converter with 4 inputs.

The inputs can be used single ended or in certain differential combinations.

The driver offers access to all available combinations by 7 "virtual" inputs:
in0: Voltage over AIN0 and AIN1.
in1: Voltage over AIN0 and AIN3.
in2: Voltage over AIN1 and AIN3.
in3: Voltage over AIN2 and AIN3.
in4: Voltage over AIN0 and GND.
in5: Voltage over AIN1 and GND.
in6: Voltage over AIN2 and GND.
in7: Voltage over AIN3 and GND.
